During this milestone I will be working on creating a click-through of my application in React, using default props to populate the pages.

###  Routes:
/ -> Home
/login -> Login Page
/signup -> Signup Page
/profile -> Profile Page
/playlists -> Playlist Page
/playlists/:id -> Playlist Detail
/playlists/new -> Playlist Create
/playlists/:id -> Listen Page


Example:
1. / -> Home Page
2. /login -> Login Screen
3. /quizzes -> Quiz List
4. /quizzes/:id -> Quiz detail
5. /quizzes/new -> Quiz Create


### Things I might struggle with...
I need more practice in React, Node and Express. I really want to learn it.

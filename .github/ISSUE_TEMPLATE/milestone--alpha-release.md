During this milestone, I will be working on integrating the API and Back-end and working out final details of the app.

### Use Case Testing

* Users are able to create a playlist of music or choose a playlist that's already curated
 * [ ] New users can create accounts
 * [ ] Existing users are able to login and logout
  * [ ] Existing users can close their browser without terminating their authenticated session
      * [ ] Authenticated user can login to Spotify and listen to their playlist on that app
      * [ ] Authenticated user can create playlist by adding songs from the database
 
Example:

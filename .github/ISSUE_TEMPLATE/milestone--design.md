During this milestone, I will be working on creating a click-through of my application in Adobe XD.

### UI Kit:
I will be using the following Visual Frameworks (VF) and UI kits: Bootstrap & Material Bootstrap UI

Recommended VF/UI Kits:
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) [UI Kit](https://xdresources.co/resources/bootstrap-4-ui)
- [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) [UI Kit](https://material.io/archive/guidelines/resources/sticker-sheets-icons.html#sticker-sheets-icons-components)
- [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/) [UI Kit](https://adobexd.uservoice.com/forums/353007-adobe-xd-feature-requests/suggestions/13167174-place-to-share-ui-kits)

*If you choose another, make sure it has both a UI kit for XD and react components, this will significantly speed up your design and build time.*

### Things I might struggle with...
I've only used Bootstrap while at Full Sail. I need to get more familiar with it, which is why I chose it over Foundation. Bootstrap may be my only learning curve for this milestone.

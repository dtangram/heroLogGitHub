# Hero-Log

## Application Definition Statement

*The application I’m building is for owners of comic books to inventory their comic book collection. The collector has comic books but does not have a digital catalogue of them. He doesn’t have the desire to buy a server and load his comic book data on the server because that’s a very involved process. He has unintentionally bought multiple copies of the same comic book because he didn’t remember if he previously bought it. The user can use the Website to enter the name of the comic book, the issue number, the publisher, the artist of the cover, the artist of the inside pages, colorist, writer, month and year and the comic book condition. In later updates, the user will be able to add an image of the comic book cover and scan the comic book UPC code with the camera on their smart phone to load the information into the database automatically.*

## Target Market

*The target market is males at least 45 years old who love comic books and have over 50 comic books in their collection. They would be known in the industry as legacy readers, which are readers who started reading comic books since the inception of comic book magazines to the 1990s. They will possess educational degrees in and be employed in computer science, Web design/development, engineering or software engineering with a yearly salary of over $75, 000. Their hobbies would be collecting comic books, collecting action figures and engaging in online conversations or debates about comic books, comic book movies or action figures. The user would not be happy with the abandonment of legacy readers like themselves by the comic publishers to focus on targeting new readers.*

## User Profile
*![Screenshot]( Profile1.jpg)*

*User 1’s hobby is collecting and reading comic books, a member of and participates in comic book and geek/nerd groups or forums for anything related to comic books such as, action figures, movies, TV shows or animation. He is 53 years old and has been working as a Network Engineer at ATT for 15 years. He needs to catalogue his comic books for insurance purposes. He also needs to keep track of his comic books’ conditions, worth and quantity without having to search the physical copies. He gets very annoyed by the alterations to his favorite comic book characters.*

*User 2’s hobby is also collecting and reading comic books, as well as collecting super hero action figures. He is also a member of and participates in comic book and geek/nerd groups or forums for anything related to comic books, action figures, movies, TV shows or animation. He is 66 years old and has retired after 20 years of being an IT Admin for Comcast Cable. He needs to inventory his books in case he wants to trade, sell them or buy another comic book. He gets upset at the lack of use of source material in comic book movies.*

## Use Cases

*User 1 is at a comic book convention and wants to buy Impulse #1, which is a comic book that’s hard to find. However, he is not sure if he has it already. Fortunately, he looks at his inventory on the Website using his smart device and finds that he purchased that comic book two years ago.  He can choose to buy it again or not. In another scenario, User 1 visits an online comic book price guide and see’s that his Batman: Death in the Family, issue #400, is now worth $100 in mint condition. He checks his Website to see the condition of the version he has. His version is in near mint condition; which is only worth $85, according to the online price guide.*

*User 2 was able to take out insurance on his comic book collection by using the inventory he added on the Website. A year later, a hurricane leveled his house and ruined his collection. He was able to use the data in the Website to begin restoring his comic book collection. He was also able to give the insurance company the value of his loss by using the data he stored in the Website for his comic book collection.*

## Problem Statement

*Cataloging a comic book collection by writing the collection in notepads is tedious, tiresome and time consuming. Some collectors use note cards or some other paper filling method to inventory their collection. (Albert, “Why You Should Use Comic Collecting Software”) Taking pictures of the comics is faster, but not detailed enough to keep good records. Entering the information into a spreadsheet is better, but can’t be accessed remotely and the information is not displayed in a manner that is easy to visually absorb. Carrying notebooks is more practical, but it is still inconvenient. (Don Comic Book Junkie, “Junkies How I Organize My Comic Book Collection PT. 1 (from notepad to clz)”) Buying a computer to enter the comic books into a database requires more effort than a user is willing spend. (Drang, “Building a Comic Book Inventory”).*

## Pain Points

*Scanning comics into a computer to enter into a database is very labor intensive. (Davenport, “Digital Backups of Physical Comics?”) Forgetting that a comic book issue is already in the collection then buying it again is a nuisance. This is a major waste of money if the collector didn’t intend to have more than one copy of the same issue. They would have to trade it with another collector for something else or sell it for a lower price, which all equates to a loss of money. (Prieto, “How To Keep Track of All Your Comic Books!”) Comic Book cataloging apps and Websites offer more than a collector needs. Therefore, the user reverts back to earlier methods to inventory their comics, like scanning and logging by hand. (Kamekazieguy, “How I Catalogue My Comics”)*

## Solution Statement

*To solve the problem of having to scan comic book cover as the only way of cataloging, entering the data into a spreadsheet or logging the comic books in a notebook, competitors allow users to enter the information into a database, but the user has to purchase the app or software to accomplish this. Hero-Log will allow users to log their info for a significantly low cost. As a resolution to the issue of unintentionally buying duplicate comic book issues, competitors use a website or app so that the user can check their inventory to see if they already have a copy of the comic book. Hero-Log will address this issue the same way, and will be releasing an app at a later date. The problem of too many features is created by competitors. Because Hero-Log will be at a lower cost the user continues to see the value of the app no matter how many features they use in the app or not.*

## Competition

*1. ComicBase Professional offers free software with limitations and paid software. Users can search and setup wishlists. (Albert, “Why You Should Use Comic Collecting Software?”)*

*2. Comic Collector Live offer downloads of full issue runs instead of entering in all of the data. (Albert, “Why You Should Use Comic Collecting Software?”)*

*3. Comic Book Collector Database allow users to filter and sort their collection. They offer scanning and manual barcode entry. (AppAdvice, “Quick and Easy Comic Book Cataloging”)*

*4. CLZ Comics offers users the ability to download comic book details from their online database. Users can scan barcodes using their smartphone. The app allows users to share their list with CLZ Cloud. (AppAdvice, “Quick and Easy Comic Book Cataloging”)*

*5. My Comic Book Collection allows users to import images of their comics into a photo library, and add details like artist, author, publisher, etc. Users can add more than one image an item. (AppAdvice, “Quick and Easy Comic Book Cataloging”)*

## Key Features

*1. Data Entry – The Website allows users to enter data into the database about their comic book to fully describe it. This addresses the problem of simply scanning the comic book and not having metadata for it. It is also a solution for entering the collection in a notepad or spreadsheet.*

*2. Prevent Unwanted Duplicates – Users are able to update, delete and add comic books into their accounts from anywhere and check their catalogue from anywhere. This solves the issue of collectors unknowingly repurchasing comic books they already have.*

*3. Simple UX – User experience is in the app is well-thought so that users are not overwhelmed with the Website so that they can quickly update their database. Users won’t be burdened with too many choices.*

*4. Use currency exchange for selling comics books from the user's collection.*
